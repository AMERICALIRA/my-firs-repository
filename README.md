Modify the contents of the file using the editor and then scroll down. You will see two input fields. These fields allow you to create commit messages for the remote repo just like the git commit -m command did for our local repo. Type in a commit message and then click the Commit changes button.

While GitHub gives us a nice UI for editing files, committing a change in their UI has the same effect on the remote repository that modifying a file locally and then using git add and git commit does on our local repo. Once again, we're editing files directly on GitHub for purposes of this book only, as this is something you rarely want to do in real projects.
